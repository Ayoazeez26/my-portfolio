  Hi, I’m **Abdulhakeem Abdulazeez**, a frontend-focused full-stack developer based in Nigeria.
  Over the past several years, I’ve worked on building modern web applications that balance
  performance, clarity, and real-world usability, products that don’t just work, but feel good to use.<br/><br/>

  I studied **Mechanical Engineering at a federal university in Nigeria**, where I developed a strong
  foundation in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and systems design. That background strongly
  influences how I approach software development today, breaking down complex problems, thinking in
  systems, and building solutions that are both efficient and reliable. Over time, I transitioned
  fully into software development, where I found the perfect intersection of logic, creativity,
  and user experience.<br/><br/>

  Today, I primarily work with **Vue.js, Nuxt.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS**, while also building
  and integrating full-stack solutions using tools like **Next.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL, Redis**, and
  third-party APIs. I enjoy working in environments where code quality, collaboration, and attention
  to detail matter.

  ### My Development Process

  My development process is driven by **clarity, empathy, and maintainability**. I start by
  understanding the problem deeply, what the user is trying to achieve and where friction exists,
  before writing a single line of code. From there, I focus on building scalable, well-structured
  solutions that are easy to extend and reason about.<br/><br/>

  I care a lot about **pixel-perfect execution**, accessibility, and performance. Whether I'm
  implementing responsive layouts, handling complex state, integrating APIs, or working on i18n
  and authentication flows, my goal is always the same: ship reliable features without unnecessary
  complexity.

  ### What Drives Me

  I'm motivated by the challenge of turning complex requirements into clean, intuitive interfaces.
  I enjoy learning new tools, refining my opinions about frontend architecture, and improving how
  products are built, not just how they look. Seeing users interact smoothly with something I helped
  create is what keeps me excited about this work.<br/><br/>

  I'm also interested in mentorship, documentation, and sharing lessons learned through content,
  especially around modern frontend development and real-world project experience.

  ### Beyond the Screen

  Outside of work, I enjoy playing football with friends, gaming (FIFA and Call of Duty), reading,
  and unwinding on TikTok or Instagram. These breaks help me recharge and come back to problem-solving
  with a fresh perspective.<br/><br/>
